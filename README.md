# Webscraping_project
This project automates the extraction of financial data for various Indian industry sectors using web scraping techniques. By scraping structured HTML tables from [Screener.in](https://www.screener.in), we compile sector-wise financial comparisons into pandas DataFrames for further analysis or export.
